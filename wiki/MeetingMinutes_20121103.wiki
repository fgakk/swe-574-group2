==Meeting decisions - 3rd November, 2012==

 1. Put the data fetched from web service into a dropdownlist.

This method also takes an integer parameter (parentCategoryId) to bring the child categories to be put into a second dropdownlist.

 2. Implement entry adding via web site. User pins the location of the violation on the map, selects a category (and an optional sub-category) from the dropdownlist, enters an optional comment and uploads an image of the violation



=== To-do for the web service === 
 1. User login session issue will be analyzed.

 2. New methods will be released; priority is VoteUp and VoteDown for an existing entry.

 3. Put the web service code to the svn trunk.

 4. Start implementing the admin operations.
